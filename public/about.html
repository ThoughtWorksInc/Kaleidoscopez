    <h1>ABOUT</h1>

    <p>Kaleidoscopez is your friendly neighborhood application that lets you know all there is to know happening across the globe in technology, news, art, fashion, penguins and anything else that you might be interested in. It goes to your favorite RSS feeds and Twitter and gets you everything that is new for your viewing pleasure. And it makes this mess look as pretty as a Lamborghini Countach.</p>

    <p>Find yourself gaping at the screen hours on end as you find out more and more and are transfixed by the sheer visual treat that is Kaleidoscopez. It is as easy to use as entering a URL in your favourite browser and hitting enter. </p>

    <p>Also, keeping in mind, how you hate reading huge volumes of text and prefer the loving stare of pretty pictures, we filter the content to ensure it keeps the number of words to a bare minimum and gives you pictures to keep looking at to keep your inner intellectual happy. Aren't we a thoughtful bunch? </p>

    <p>Kaleidoscopez now supports channels, with each channel maintaining its own choice of feeds to display. This allows you to configure what you would rather be viewing over what your grandmother or your milkman or I might be viewing. For those of you who can't buy their girlfriends anything expensive on their birthdays or anniversaries, you can make them a channel on Kaleidoscopez, immediately guarunteeing their love for you for the rest of their lives. </p>

    <p>All money raised by this application will be going into the scientific research on creating Unicorns to roam our free world. So donate generously. </p>
