        <h1>About Kaleidoscopez</h1>

        <p>Kaleidoscopez is your friendly neighborhood application that lets you know all there is to know happening across the globe in technology, news, art, fashion, penguins and anything else that you might be interested in. It goes to your favorite RSS feeds and Twitter and gets you everything that is new for your viewing pleasure. And it makes this mess look very pretty.</p>

        <p>Kaleidoscopez is all about the community. It targets a gathering that could be social or professional in nature. It drives information radiation and also tries to serve as ice breakers in conversations and improve communication in the masses.</p>

        <p>Also, it is very convenient and easy to get to. Just enter the URL in your favourite browser and your are good to go.</p>

        <p>Also, keeping in mind, how you hate reading huge volumes of text and prefer the loving stare of pretty pictures, we filter the content to ensure it keeps the number of words to a bare minimum and gives you pictures to keep it simple and effective in communication. Aren't we a thoughtful bunch?</p>

        <p>Kaleidoscopez also supports channels, with each channel maintaining its own choice of feeds to display. This allows you to configure what you would rather be viewing over what your grandmother or your milkman or I might be viewing. It is very simple to create your own chanel and it might also serve as a neat gift for those special occasions. </p>

        <p>All money raised by this application will be going into the scientific research on creating Unicorns to roam our free world. So donate generously. </p>
