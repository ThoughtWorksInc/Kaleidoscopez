        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>We are a bunch of developers at ThoughtWorks, Pune who have worked on Kaleidoscopez for a few weeks now. For most of us on the project, this was the first project that we had worked on and it started with a heavy learning curve.</p>

        <p>It all started with the idea of having an application that could be used to spread information office wide in a non-intrusive fashion to let them know whats new in the office. That seed idea kept growing in intent till we decided we could make an app that would pick up its material from various RSS feeds, Twitter and similar information media and would broadcast these in an easy to digest fashion being heavy on images and keeps the text to headlines and really short summaries to make this a fun and visual app in nature. It had its fair share of challenges but it was all fun.</p>

        <p>Chirag Doshi, Lead Consultant at ThoughtWorks was the brains behind the entire project. Kirti Agarwal was the Buisness Analyst on the project for the most important phase of it. The developers who worked on it are Piyush Nimbalkar, Sonia Ghanekar, Satyam Agarwala, Akshay Mankar, Yahya Poonawala and Ashwin Venkatesh. All of us are employees of ThoughtWorks India, except for Satyam who works out of our Singapore office.</p>
